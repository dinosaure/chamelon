# what is this?

An implementation of [LittleFS](https://github.com/littlefs-project/littlefs) for the MirageOS [BLOCK](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-block) API, and exposing the MirageOS [FS](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-fs) interface.

# what isn't this?

Performant. Wear-alert. Making big promises. Well-tested. Backed by Big Camel or suitable for Big Data.

# why though?

Sometimes you just gotta store some stuff. You don't have to store much stuff and you don't have to do it very often but people are gonna get real mad if you don't do it at least a little.
